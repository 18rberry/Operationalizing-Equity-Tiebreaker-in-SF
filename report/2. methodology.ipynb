    "1. The eligibility step selects blocks which should be considered for the tiebreaker. This is a qualitative step, that functions to consider non-demographic block features and align the tiebreaker with greater policy goals. These criteria may not depend on the definition of focal students, so that they would not be satisfied by an \"optimal\" tiebreaker necessairily. For example, in this step we can consider criteria such as:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. Is the block in a neighborhood with low access to resources?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Is the block in a previously red-lined zone?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Is the block in a neighborhood with high percentage of focal students?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. Does the block contains a federal public housing project?\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The qualification step optimizes the block selection by maximizing the number of focal students receiving a tiebreaker while minimizing the number of non-focal students receiving a tiebreaker. This is a mathematical step, and it crucially depends on the definition of focal students. Only eligible blocks are considered."

    "\n",
    "The qualification criteria provides some mathematical optimality guarantee. Besides, it reduces the gameability of the system: the eligibility step is deterministic, and often based on criteria that do not depend on demographic changes. A non-focal family who wants to take advantage of the tiebreaker, aware of the eligibility criteria, could move to a block that satisfies those criteria; if there was no qualification step then they would certainly receive the tiebreaker. However with the qualification step the percentage of focal students in a block is recomputed (hopefully annually or biannually), so that displacement could cause a block to lose its tiebreaker."
