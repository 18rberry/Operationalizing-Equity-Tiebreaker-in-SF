After blocks are pre-selected by these criteria, the demographic composition of the block should be taken into account to actually decide upon the tiebreaker.\n",

For example, accessibility and public transportation or gentrification. Importantly, the eligibility criteria can be provided at a coarser level than the blocks, so that more datasets are potentially available."
