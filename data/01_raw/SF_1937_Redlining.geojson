The narrow strip from 27th Avenue east to 16th Avenue is an older district, but it is highly regarded as a residential area even though some of the residences range up to 30 years in age. In Sea Cliff proper the oldest structure is approximately 18 years old, the bulk of the houses having been built ten years ago. Sea Cliff is highly restricted to single-family residences, both by ordinance and deed. The other section is zoned by ordinance only, and a few four-family flats and one or two apartments were built in this district before the zoning ordinance came into effect. This does not have a detrimental influence, however. The appraised values of the residences in Sea Cliff range from $9500 to $50,000, and in the area lying to the east, range from $5,000 to $25,000. The area is inhabited largely by professional and business men of the executive type, having incomes ranging from $4,000 to $40,000. The income level of around $5,000 predominates. Infiltration of inharmonious racial elements is very remote, and maintenance is of a high order. There are comparatively to vacancies in this area, which is approximately 90% owner-occupied. Schools of all grades are within easy walking distance, transportation facilities are adequate, and parks and recreational areas are nearby. A few of the homes fronting on the ocean to the north have a privately-owned beach. Bordering on the north and east is the U.S. Military Reservation known as the Presidio, and a U.S. Marine Hospital and a large reservoir lie just outside the area. These are not considered a detrimental influence, but rather a benefit, as they are well-kept and insure seclusion. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $10,000 in 1929, $7500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $9,000. The same home would have rented for $90 a month in 1929, $60 a month in 1933, and $80 a month now."}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-122.460893,37.73566],[-122.461018,37.735722],[-122.461278,37.735886],[-122.461649,37.736092],[-122.46197,37.736176],[-122.462176,37.736247],[-122.46243,37.736371],[-122.462533,37.736416],[-122.462847,37.736523],[-122.462832,37.736365],[-122.462832,37.736241],[-122.462847,37.736083],[-122.462904,37.735971],[-122.463032,37.735903],[-122.463232,37.735801],[-122.46336,37.735745],[-122.463745,37.7357],[-122.46393,37.735722],[-122.46413,37.735745],[-122.46418,37.735727],[-122.464373,37.735655],[-122.464301,37.735474],[-122.464244,37.735215],[-122.46413,37.73482],[-122.464059,37.734471],[-122.464187,37.734053],[-122.464387,37.73367],[-122.464658,37.733501],[-122.465,37.733343],[-122.465441,37.733224],[-122.465542,37.733196],[-122.465927,37.733128],[-122.466497,37.733072],[-122.471538,37.733262],[-122.471433,37.733721],[-122.471419,37.733785],[-122.471411,37.73385],[-122.471411,37.733915],[-122.471418,37.73398],[-122.471432,37.734044],[-122.471452,37.734107],[-122.47148,37.734168],[-122.471514,37.734227],[-122.471555,37.734284],[-122.471281,37.734711],[-122.471062,37.735016],[-122.470805,37.735256],[-122.469864,37.735978],[-122.470159,37.73623],[-122.469953,37.736445],[-122.466691,37.739274],[-122.466429,37.739194],[-122.466275,37.739194],[-122.466067,37.739344],[-122.46571,37.739518],[-122.46476,37.73988],[-122.464367,37.740007],[-122.464029,37.740105],[-122.463833,37.740134],[-122.463399,37.740171],[-122.463042,37.740237],[-122.462799,37.74027],[-122.462395,37.740279],[-122.461723,37.740331],[-122.46101,37.740383],[-122.460582,37.740462],[-122.460255,37.740524],[-122.460195,37.740527],[-122.460216,37.740347],[-122.46024,37.740182],[-122.46024,37.740058],[-122.460178,37.739982],[-122.460097,37.739873],[-122.460126,37.739738],[-122.460164,37.739667],[-122.46024,37.739547],[-122.460425,37.739457],[-122.460596,37.739412],[-122.460839,37.739321],[-122.460996,37.739243],[-122.46121,37.739096],[-122.461338,37.738904],[-122.461452,37.738577],[-122.461309,37.737822],[-122.460893,37.73566]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"A10","holc_grade":"A","area_description_data":{"1":"This area of 25 irregularly-shaped blocks is approximately 85% developed. It is known as St. Francis Wood and ranks as one of the best laid out and restricted residential sub-divisions in San Francisco. The restrictions are first-residential, permitting single-family residences only, and their architecture is controlled by a board, resulting in uniformity and harmony in improvements. The tract is well-landscaped and is considered the most popular sub-division in its class. It has an undulating topography with rolling elevations from the east to the west, and the streets are contoured for easy grades and maximum construction for view. The improvements in this area have a cost range from $6,000 to $30,000, with the $10,000 house predominating. The range in age is from new to 20 years, the $10,000 house predominating. The range in age is from new to 20 years, the majority of the homes having been erected within the past 12 years. Good grade schools, transportation, parks, shopping, and recreational areas are conveniently located. There are no deterring influences, and there exists a very high percentage of home ownership, with practically no vacancies. There is an upkeep tax approximately $2,50 per lot monthly, which is judiciously expended in keeping up parks, tennis courts, etc. which belong to the tract. This expenditure has resulted in a neighborhood of great charm and attractiveness, which adds materially to property values in the area. The lots in this sub-division maintained their values even during the depression period. Lots are selling for as high as $5,000, which is approximately the peak. The residents of this tract are made up of professional people, business executives, and a few retired capitalists, having an income range from $5,000 to $40,000. The marketability for property in this area is the highest in the entire district. This is partly due to the high standard of maintenance and proper restrictions that exist. There are a number of homes being built in this area, and construction loans area eagerly sought by all mortgagee institutions. A standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $15,000 in 1929, $10,500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $13,500.

The average size of the building sites is from 75 to 100 feet frontage. Up to 1935 only two residences were constructed in this tract, and during the past year four additional homes were erected at a cost of from $15,000 to $25,000. This area is creating considerable interest at the present time, and as the restrictions are rigidly maintained, it is believed that development will continue at a moderate rate. The property is located on the western and northern slope of Mt. Davidson, which is the highest point in San Francisco, having an elevation of 985 feet. The character of the sub-division is hilly with one or two ravines. A portion of the tract is unplanted and adjoins a 20 acre city park which includes the peak of Mt. Davidson. Residents of this tract are professional men and business executives having incomes in excess of $10,000 per year. The sub-division is somewhat remote from transportation, schools, and stores; however, with its type of inhabitants, this is not considered a serious handicap due to the fact that there are two or more automobiles in each family, with domestic help. This property, adjoining a city park, nestles on the wooded slopes of Mt. Davidson, and having an unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean for a distance of 50 miles, forms a picturesque setting for high-class development. A deterring incidence affecting this area is the season of intermittent fogs and winds which is recurrent for three or four months of the year in this section. When this sub-division was placed on the market, the sites were priced from $4,000 to $15,000, according to their size and location. However, no sales were made at these values, and the maximum price obtained to date is $45 per front foot. It is believed that, with the return of normal conditions and a better planned and more aggressive-selling campaign, it will be possible to obtain as much as $7500 for some of the choice sites. Taxes are assessed on a basis of $60 per front foot on the platted portion of the area and at $300 per acre on the unplanted part.

Davidson Manor being included in the eastern part of the area. The first construction in Balboa Terrace began in 1921, and a consistent construction program continued until 1929. This tract is located on a general slope to the west and south and is admirably suited to residential construction. It is particularly appealing to people with families, as it adjoins one of the best elementary and junior high schools in San Francisco, is adjacent to two direct car lines, and has adequate shopping and recreational facilities close at hand. This is one of the few subdivisions in the city that has rear alleys for automobile driveways, eliminating the garage entrance from the street which is very common in San Francisco. The type of homes is mostly one-story, stucco, detached with five to eight rooms, having a cost range of from $5,000 to $12,500. The property is protected by deed restrictions, and zoning is first-residential. There is an upkeep tax of approximately $1.00 per month, and the parking is well-maintained. The district is 95% owner-occupied by people of the high salaried \"white-collar\" class, business executives, and professional men. Property in this area is in popular demand, and its marketability has been above average throughout the depression. That portion of Mt. Davidson Manor which is included in this area is slightly below the standard of the homes in Balboa Terrace; however, the general character is the same. A standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $12,000 in 1929, $7500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $10,500. The same home would have rented for $100 a month in 1929, $65 a month in 1933 and $90 a month now. This area occupies an attractive setting, is harmonious in both development and population. A possible deterring influence which was considered when according the area an \"A\" rating was its high percentage of development. An off-setting factor was that property in the area is in good demand, selling readily at fair prices, and that mortgage institutions generally are willing to accord their best terms on residential loans in the area."}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-122.461018,37.735722],[-122.460893,37.73566],[-122.460542,37.735407],[-122.459658,37.734195],[-122.459045,37.735137],[-122.458824,37.735075],[-122.458617,37.735007],[-122.458168,37.735013],[-122.456984,37.735199],[-122.456784,37.735216],[-122.456485,37.73521],[-122.455444,37.73508],[-122.455173,37.735069],[-122.454916,37.735075],[-122.454132,37.735204],[-122.453889,37.735171],[-122.45333,37.735114],[-122.453316,37.73391],[-122.453462,37.733842],[-122.453695,37.733766],[-122.454019,37.733714],[-122.454337,37.733774],[-122.454789,37.73403],[-122.455359,37.734364],[-122.45583,37.734466],[-122.455996,37.734488],[-122.456158,37.734439],[-122.456163,37.734372],[-122.456129,37.73424],[-122.456006,37.734052],[-122.455991,37.733823],[-122.456063,37.733748],[-122.456524,37.733485],[-122.456557,37.73336],[-122.456548,37.7333],[-122.456353,37.732943],[-122.456283,37.732872],[-122.456176,37.732763],[-122.456075,37.732651],[-122.456012,37.732555],[-122.455955,37.732457],[-122.455904,37.732357],[-122.45586,37.732255],[-122.455823,37.732151],[-122.455793,37.732045],[-122.455765,37.731944],[-122.455742,37.731841],[-122.455726,37.731738],[-122.455716,37.731634],[-122.455711,37.73153],[-122.455713,37.731426],[-122.455721,37.731322],[-122.455734,37.731219],[-122.455754,37.731116],[-122.455815,37.731052],[-122.456167,37.730966],[-122.457148,37.730828],[-122.458277,37.730669],[-122.459335,37.730509],[-122.460518,37.730318],[-122.461502,37.730272],[-122.461549,37.73043],[-122.461854,37.730505],[-122.462596,37.730837],[-122.463197,37.731234],[-122.463809,37.731704],[-122.464712,37.732639],[-122.465441,37.733224],[-122.465,37.733343],[-122.464658,37.733501],[-122.464387,37.73367],[-122.464187,37.734053],[-122.464059,37.734471],[-122.46413,37.73482],[-122.464244,37.735215],[-122.464301,37.735474],[-122.464373,37.735655],[-122.46418,37.735727],[-122.46413,37.735745],[-122.46393,37.735722],[-122.463745,37.7357],[-122.46336,37.735745],[-122.463232,37.735801],[-122.463032,37.735903],[-122.462904,37.735971],[-122.462847,37.736083],[-122.462832,37.736241],[-122.462832,37.736365],[-122.462847,37.736523],[-122.462533,37.736416],[-122.46243,37.736371],[-122.462176,37.736247],[-122.46197,37.736176],[-122.461649,37.736092],[-122.461278,37.735886],[-122.461018,37.735722]],[[-122.463907,37.734423],[-122.463525,37.73411],[-122.46293,37.7349],[-122.46298,37.734925],[-122.463069,37.734993],[-122.463186,37.735083],[-122.463272,37.735162],[-122.46339,37.735314],[-122.463425,37.73541],[-122.463454,37.735486],[-122.463514,37.735559],[-122.463611,37.735613],[-122.46411,37.735669],[-122.464142,37.735652],[-122.464167,37.73563],[-122.464242,37.735548],[-122.464235,37.735495],[-122.464192,37.735393],[-122.464103,37.735244],[-122.464021,37.735035],[-122.463981,37.73484],[-122.463942,37.734575],[-122.463907,37.734423]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"A13","holc_grade":"A","area_description_data":{"1":"This area of some 25 irregularly-shaped blocks comprises the subdivision which is known as Monterey Heights and the western portion of Westwood Highlands.

Buildings in this area range from new to an age of 40 years and have a cost range of from $20,000 to $150,000 or more. Owing to the architectural and structural soundness of its improvements and desirability of location, it is difficult to determine the remaining economic life of this district. None of the older improvements have been allowed to become obsolete, and they have been in many cases entirely remodeled and completely modernized. It is quite possible, owing to its natural advantages and the other factors mentioned, that this district will remain the outstanding residential district of San Francisco for a great many years to come. It is not feasible to estimate the fluctuation in values of a typical house in this district during the past eight years, for two reasons: first, that there is no typical house in this area of the smaller variety and, secondly, in the bottom of the depression there was absolutely no market for property of the predominating type in this area. Considerable activity is shown in this class of property at the present time, and it is safe to say that prices will soon be back to the 1929 level."}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-122.473099,37.734603],[-122.472365,37.734641],[-122.472284,37.734638],[-122.472204,37.73463],[-122.472126,37.734616],[-122.472048,37.734598],[-122.471973,37.734574],[-122.471901,37.734545],[-122.471833,37.734512],[-122.471768,37.734474],[-122.471707,37.734432],[-122.471651,37.734386],[-122.4716,37.734337],[-122.471555,37.734284],[-122.471514,37.734227],[-122.47148,37.734168],[-122.471452,37.734107],[-122.471432,37.734044],[-122.471418,37.73398],[-122.471411,37.733915],[-122.471411,37.73385],[-122.471419,37.733785],[-122.471433,37.733721],[-122.471538,37.733262],[-122.471923,37.731581],[-122.471959,37.731093],[-122.471966,37.731],[-122.471966,37.731],[-122.474698,37.730949],[-122.474698,37.730949],[-122.47685,37.73091],[-122.48147,37.730898],[-122.48249,37.730938],[-122.482462,37.73435],[-122.48592,37.734146],[-122.485852,37.735615],[-122.485814,37.736424],[-122.485808,37.73655],[-122.485668,37.736505],[-122.485532,37.736466],[-122.4854,37.736432],[-122.485273,37.736404],[-122.485149,37.736382],[-122.485029,37.736366],[-122.484912,37.736355],[-122.484797,37.736349],[-122.484684,37.736349],[-122.484571,37.736355],[-122.484459,37.736366],[-122.484345,37.736383],[-122.484237,37.736404],[-122.484121,37.736431],[-122.484005,37.736461],[-122.483686,37.73655],[-122.483585,37.736575],[-122.483493,37.736595],[-122.483384,37.736616],[-122.483278,37.736631],[-122.483172,37.736642],[-122.483067,37.736648],[-122.483001,37.73665],[-122.482934,37.73665],[-122.482867,37.736648],[-122.482799,37.736644],[-122.48273,37.736639],[-122.48266,37.736632],[-122.482589,37.736623],[-122.482516,37.736612],[-122.482443,37.736599],[-122.482368,37.736585],[-122.482292,37.736569],[-122.482215,37.736551],[-122.482056,37.736509],[-122.481891,37.73646],[-122.481872,37.735718],[-122.479501,37.734964],[-122.479166,37.734839],[-122.478301,37.734518],[-122.478169,37.734517],[-122.477903,37.734515],[-122.478085,37.737398],[-122.475091,37.737485],[-122.474817,37.734536],[-122.473099,37.734603]],[[-122.478074,37.732747],[-122.478155,37.73426],[-122.479153,37.734258],[-122.47912,37.732724],[-122.478074,37.732747]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"A6","holc_grade":"A","area_description_data":{"1":"This area, containing some 20 blocks, is the city's newest restricted, single-family residential sub-division, the main portion of which was placed on the market in 1931 and two smaller tracts platted in 1936. This area is located in what is known as the \"West of Twin Peaks\" section, the most popular medium-priced, better-class section in San Francisco. This section or district of San Francisco is, generally speaking, the only portion that carries deed restrictions and has the added advantage of being sub-divided into wider lots occupied by detached homes. The improvements in this area consist mainly of one-story, frame, single-family residences of five to eight rooms, all stucco exteriors, detached, and many of them having tiled roofs. The cost range of dwellings is from $7,000 to $12,000. No building in this area is older than five years, and over 50%f were constructed within the past two years. F. H. A. Title II loans have been a large factor in the development of this area, which is inhabited largely by the medium-income \"white collar\" class, professional men, small business owner, and executives, having incomes ranging from $3,000 to $6,000 or more. Property is protected by single-family deed restrictions and \"first-residential\" zoning. There are no racial threats, and maintenance is of a high order. The area is 95% owner-occupied, with no vacancies and is approximately 60% built-up. Building activity in this area is very brisk, and as the owners of the three sub-divisions are builders and developers, it is logical to assume that the entire area will be 95% developed within the next two years. Property has some view, convenience to schools, transportation, and recreational areas. A parked reservoir adds to the charm of the neighborhood. This is considered the \"hot spot\" of new residential construction in the $8,000 to $12,500 class. Presuming its existence, a standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $13,500 in 1929, $8,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $12,500. The same home would have rented for $110 a month in 1929, $75 a month in 1933 and $95 a month now.

This tunnel, 2 1/4 miles long, was completed in 1916 and supplies direct rail transportation from the area known as \"West of the Twin Peaks\" to the City Center and other points. The construction of this tunnel opened up some three or four thousand acres of dormant land into a better-type of restricted sub-division. The average size of lots in this area is 33 1/3 by 100 feet. The street improvements, though costly due to the topography, were not accepted by the city and are being kept in repair by the Forest Hill Association, a non-profit corporation made up of property owners within the tract, for the purpose of maintaining streets, landscaping, and generally enforcing the restrictions. This association is functioning well, and the tract and streets are well-maintained. There is a special tax levy of 3/10 of a mill per square foot monthly for maintenance. Most of the residences in this tract are of the two-story, six to eight-room type, their prices ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, protected by deed restriction and zoning to single-family residences only. The tract is approximately 60% built-up and largely owner-occupied with less than 3% vacancy. Portion of this sub-division are convenient to shops, schools, and transportation, while other portions are somewhat removed from transportation facilities. The residents in this area are largely made up of the \"white collar\" class in the middle-salaried brackets and professional and business men, having an income range from $2500 to $7500. Infiltration of inharmonious social elements is not anticipated.

The residents of this area consists of junior executives, some professional and business men, and some highly-skilled mechanics, having an income range from $2,000 to $6,000. Improvements are made up of from five to eight-rooms, one and two-story, single-family, detached, frame and stucco homes, with a cost range from $4,000 to $10,000. The age of these structures is from new to 20 years old, with a majority of them erected between six to twelve years ago. Homes are conveniently located to schools, transportation and shops, and they are 80% to 90% owner-occupied with few vacancies. Maintenance in the area is of a high character and racial problems very remote. Property in this area is in good demand, and mortgagee officials consider it excellent lending territory. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8500 in 1929, $4500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $7500. The same home would have rented for $80 a month in 1929, 445 a month in 1933, and $70 a month now.

It constitutes the western portion of the \"Richmond District\", and is zoned second-residential, with the exception of one block and five half-blocks, zoned first residential, and 37 quarter-blocks on Balboa and Cabrillo Streets zoned for business. A well developed shopping center occupies this zoning. There are no deed restrictions. The area is popular with the medium income group of professional and business me, \"white collar\" workers, and higher-class skilled mechanics and artisans. Annual incomes range from $1800 to $5,000. There is no threat of undesirable racial influences. The eastern part of the area is 90% built-up, tapering off to 50% in the extreme western portion, being 75% to 80% developed as a whole. Improvements consist of stucco, frame and stucco, row and detached houses and bungalows, costing from $4,000 to $7,000, with a number of two-family flats and small corner apartment houses in the $7,000 to $12,000 cost range. While somewhat heterogeneously developed in spots, maintenance is generally good, indicating a pride of ownership. A few buildings were erected some 30 years ago, but a majority of the property has been improved since 1920. On the northwest boundary of the area, below a bluff, lies the far-framed \"cliff House\" and \"Seal Rocks\"; on the south it joins Golden Gate Park, while to the north is the Lincoln Park Municipal Gold Links. These all add to the attractiveness of the district. Good schools, and churches are conveniently located, and the area, which is densely populated, is served by four car lines to the City Center, which is four or 4 1/2 miles distant. This distance from the down-town district and the time consumed in getting there, is a deterring influence, as is the fog and wind condition which prevails at certain seasons of the year. Although rising land values tend to increase the burden of ownership, the tax situation as a whole is equitable. The classification of this area as \"blue\" does not complete the picture. There are spotted blocks here and there which could be designated \"high yellow\", and on the other hand, there area scattered blocks fronting Golden Gate Park which could be classed as \"low green\". There are also 12 blocks in the northwest section of the area adjoining Sutro Heights and the military reservation, which are hilly and afford a pleasing view of the Pacific Oceas and Golden Gate Park, that are less than 50% improved and give evidence of developing into a higher grade, possibly a \"high blue\" or \"low green\". At present the same general characteristics justify the inclusion of this district in one area, but within ten years it will have to be broken up into a number of separate units. Already parts have reached a peak and are in that static stage which precedes a decline. Marteksbility in the area is generally good, with values tending upward.

The improvements uniformly consist of stucco and frame, row, five and six-room houses and bungalows, with full basement for garage space, valued at from $5,000 to $7,000 and ranging in age from new to 10 years old.

There are two grade schools in the area, and high school facilities are convenient. A car line and a bus line traverse the area, and another car line runs the length of its northern border. Nearby parks and recreational areas add to the attractiveness of the area. A majority of houses were erected by speculative builders, and the impression was gained that they were \"built to sell\". However, the architecture is good, and there is apparently little sales resistance. There is said to be an excellent demand for property in this area at current prices. F. H. A.

Schools and transportation, except by private automobile, are not conveniently available, and high winds and fogs also constitute a detrimental influence.

It is approximately 85% built-up and is largely inhabited by \"white collar\" workers, laborers, factory workers, etc. having incomes ranging from $1,000 to $2400. There are no racial concentrations, and foreign infiltration is felt to be remote. Maintenance is generally mediocre, but certain spots in the area evidence a fair pride of ownership. This district is approximately 40 years old and has had an intermittent development. The improvements range from new to the age of the area and consist of various and sundry types of houses, bungalows, flats and apartments. The single-family residences are valued at from $3,000 to $6,000 and are 75% owner-occupied, with 23% tenancies and 2% vacancies. The area is zoned  second-residential with a few blocks permitting business structures which are occupied by shops and markets. Schools and transportation facilities, parks, and playgrounds are all conveniently available. Mortgagee officials quite generally recognize that while safe loans may be made in the area, great care must be exercised. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $5,000 in 1929, $3,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $4,000.
